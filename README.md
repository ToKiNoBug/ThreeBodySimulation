# UniSimulator
 Simulate N-body problem in D-dimension space ---- provided that the inverse square law is suitable for any dimensional space.

Implemented algorithms:
- Euler method
- 4 rank Runge-Kutta fixed step method
- Traditional 4 rank Runge-Kutta variable step method (control error with position and velocity)(best recommended)

Other functions:
- Save parameters (initial condition) as files.
- Load parameters from files.
- Save result (the whole path) as files.
- Load result from files.
